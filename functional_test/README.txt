=========== EXAMPLES =========== 

This package contains example programs that use the algae components to solve
various problems. These are not presented as optimal approaches, rather as
useful examples that can be followed in order to set up your own experiments.

See the README.txt files in each package for a description of the problem and
the approach used to solve it.
