A member is made up of
=> a genome
=> fitness

A Genome is made up of:
=> one or more homologous chromosome groups
=> homologous chromosome group contains chromosomes of the same length and allele type

A Chromosome is made up of
=> a fixed number of alleles (although alleles are not identified individually by the framework)

ChromosomeFactory
=> creates random chromosomes
=> creates empty chromosomes
=> mutates a single allele in a chromosome

PhenotypeMapper
=> transforms a Genome into a phenotype (Object)

FitnessTester
=> measures the fitness of a phenotype

Selector
=> selects a member from a population (input only population size or whole population or some other population statistic?)

Gamete
=> Sex cell containing half the number of chromosomes
=> Each chromosome made from crossover (and mutation) applied to each set of chromosomes
=> Made by a single individual

Parameters - dynamic control over a running experiment
=> PopulationSize
=> ElitismCount
=> CrossOverProbabilityPerAllele (for each chromosome set?)
=> MutationProbabilityPerAllele (for each chromosome set?)
=> Selector
=> MultiplicityOfGenome is constant
=> NumberOfParents is constant
=> Constraint: MultiplicityOfGenome % NumberofParents == 0 (if crossover using gametes)
=> Array of chromosome factories
=> PhenotypeMapper (genome => phenotype)
=> FitnessTester(phenotype => fitness)
